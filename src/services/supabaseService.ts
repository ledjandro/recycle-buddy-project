Using a hammer and nail, carefully punch a hole in the center of the lid. Thread your pendant light cord through this hole from inside the lid. Next, secure the socket to the lid following the kit instructions. Select a decorative Edison bulb that will fit inside the jar. Screw the rim back onto the jar with the light assembly. Finally, hang your new pendant light and adjust the cord length as needed. This makes an excellent light fixture for kitchen islands, dining areas, or bedside tables.",
